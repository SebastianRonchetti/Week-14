# BaSP - Stage 3 - Week 14

This project consists of a series of end-to-end tests for the various users of the page
'SwagLabs' (https://www.saucedemo.com/), and their various functionalities.

### Installation
```
To install this test package download it into your device
- Perform npm install on your downloaded folder from your command prompt
- execute npm run test from the command prompt
```
This project runs tests for 4 different entities:
- standard_user
- locked_out_user
- problem_user
- performance_glitch_user

The project assumes the various glitches and bugs of each entity to be a feature and/or
functionality specific to that user. Hence why some tests will result positive even when
the actual result might be judged otherwise in a real testing enviroment or exercise
